# CSE330 File Sharing Website
This repo contains my implementation of CSE 330 module 2, a file sharing website.
It was created fall 2022.

The spec can be found [here]([https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse330/index.php?title=Module_2](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse330/index.php?title=Module_2#Group_Project)).

## Creative Portion
The users have a quota, which is 2MB.
Every time the user uploads, the counter is updated at the bottom.
The user may not upload over the quota.

There is also an option to download a ZIP of all a user's files.
